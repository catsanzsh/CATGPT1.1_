Welcome to CatGPT 1.5Infinite-Horizon World Generation with Real-Time Interaction

AI Cat Foundation

"This is the world that you know; the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call CatGPT." — Inspired by The Matrix (1999)

The First Real-Time, Frame-Level Moving Control for Realistic World Simulation!

How close are we to realizing a vision where AI crafts a fully immersive, interactive world, blurring the line between reality and illusion? Imagine a limitless digital universe, created in real-time with visuals that rival reality itself. CatGPT 1.5 is a pioneering step toward this vision—a first glimpse into humanity’s own "Matrix."

Our system breaks new ground in world simulation by delivering:

Frame-level precision in user interaction, matching the responsiveness portrayed in immersive AAA experiences.

AAA-level visuals for scenes nearly indistinguishable from reality.

Infinite generative capacity for endless exploration, surpassing the limits of current video models.

Curious? Read on to explore the technology powering CatGPT 1.5 and experience the feel of a self-sustaining digital universe!

CatGPT 1.5: Infinite-Horizon World Simulation

CatGPT 1.5 offers real-time, responsive control in both first- and third-person perspectives, enabling seamless exploration of dynamic environments. Trained on data from AAA games like Forza Horizon 5 and Cyberpunk 2077 as well as real-world footage, it lets users navigate diverse terrains—deserts, cities, forests, and more—in unbroken, continuous videos.

Each user command responds with frame-level precision, delivering a four-frame response similar to AAA games. Explore the gallery below to experience CatGPT 1.5 across immersive landscapes.
